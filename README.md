##I developed a real-time chat application using Socket.IO and Express.js as part of my CodTech internship. This app allows users to send and receive messages instantly without refreshing the page, providing a smooth chatting experience. It includes a simple chatbot that responds to basic inputs like "hello" or "help." The project features both frontend and backend integration, and runs locally at `http://localhost:3000`, demonstrating my understanding of web sockets, server setup, and real-time communication.
